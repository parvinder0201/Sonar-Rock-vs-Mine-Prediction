# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction using Sonar Data

## About

The utilization of SONAR technology has revolutionized the detection of rocks and minerals, offering insights that were previously hard to come by. By leveraging specific parameters, this technique facilitates the identification of surface targets or obstacles like rocks or mines. In today's technological landscape, machine learning has garnered significant attention across various sectors, spanning from banking to consumer and product-based industries. It has showcased remarkable advancements in predictive analytics. For instance, predictive tasks can be executed using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, which can be implemented efficiently in platforms like Google Colab.

## DataSet
The dataset used in this project is provided in a CSV format. It consists of sonar readings represented by a set of features (60 in total) and corresponding labels indicating whether the detected object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

##Pre-requisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn (for logistic regression model and metrics)


## Model
The model used here is  **Logistic Regression**. Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. Logistic Regression uses a sigmoid or logit function which will squash the best fit straight line that will map any values including the exceeding values from 0 to 1 range. So it forms an “S” shaped curve. Sigmoid func. removes the effect of outlier and makes the output between 0 to 1.
As it a binary classification model it is perfect to predict if an object is mine or rock based on the sonar data.

## Description
![screenshot](https://github.com/parvinder0201/Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction/blob/main/Dataflow.jpg?raw=true)

- Sonar data in a csv file is taken for training and testing purpose. 
- Data preprocessing is done on the available sonar data which is suitable for training the model.
- After Data preprocessing, a Logistic regression model is built. 
- The dataset is split into testing and training sets. 
- The training data is used to train the model then the new data/ testing data is given to the trained logistic regression - model for prediction.  


## Lessons Learned

- **Understanding and preprocessing the data:** It's crucial to explore the dataset thoroughly, handle missing values (if any), and preprocess the features appropriately for better model performance.
- **Model training and evaluation:** Choosing an appropriate algorithm and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy are essential steps in machine learning.
- **Interpretation of results:** Interpreting the predictions and understanding the model's decisions are vital for real-world applications.

## Future Scope
- **Experiment with other machine learning algorithms:** Apart from logistic regression, exploring other algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks could potentially improve the model's performance.
- **Feature engineering:** Experiment with feature selection techniques or engineer new features to enhance the model's predictive power.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters could lead to better performance and generalization.
- **Deployment:** Once satisfied with the model's performance, consider deploying it in real-world applications, such as underwater robotics or surveillance systems.
